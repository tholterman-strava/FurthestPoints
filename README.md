# FurthestPoints
Just a small little project to find furthest points given a csv file of coordinates. 

Download maxArea.py, download concap.csv. 

Make sure they both live in the same directory. 

Navigate to that directory in your terminal. 

Run python maxArea.py

Should print some things and the plot should show.
